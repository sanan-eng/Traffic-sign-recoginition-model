# ðŸš¦ Traffic Sign Recognition System  

A deep learning-based project that uses *Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)* to classify traffic signs from images. This system is designed to assist in *road safety, driver assistance, and autonomous vehicles*.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
Traffic signs play a vital role in regulating road traffic. This system automatically recognizes traffic signs using *image processing + deep learning, trained on the **German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)* dataset.  

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset  
- *Dataset:* GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark)  
- *Classes:* 43 traffic sign categories  
- *Training Images:* ~39,000  
- *Testing Images:* ~12,000  

---

## âš™ Tech Stack  
- *Language:* Python  
- *Libraries:* TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  
- *Model:* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
